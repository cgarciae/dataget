Main features: Minimal : Downloads entire datasets with just 1 line of code. Compatible : Loads data as numpy arrays or pandas dataframes which can be easily used with the majority of Machine Learning frameworks. Transparent : By default stores the data in your current project so you can easily inspect it. Memory Efficient : When a dataset doesn't fit in memory it will return metadata instead so you can iteratively load it. Integrates with Kaggle : Supports loading datasets directly from Kaggle in a variety of formats. Checkout the documentation for the list of available datasets. Getting Started \u00b6 In dataget you just have to do two things: Instantiate a Dataset from our collection. Call the get method to download the data to disk and load it into memory. Both are usually done in one line: import dataget X_train , y_train , X_test , y_test = dataget . vision . mnist () . get () This example downloads the MNIST dataset to ./data/vision_mnist and loads it as numpy arrays. Kaggle Support \u00b6 Kaggle promotes the use of csv files and dataget loves it! With dataget you can quickly download any dataset from the platform and have immediate access to the data: import dataget df_train , df_test = dataget . kaggle ( \"cristiangarcia/pointcloudmnist2d\" ) . get ( files = [ \"train.csv\" , \"test.csv\" ] ) To start using Kaggle datasets just make sure you have properly installed and configured the Kaggle API . In the future we want to expand Kaggle support in the following ways: Be able to load any file that numpy or pandas can read. Have generic support for other types of datasets like images, audio, video, etc. e.g dataget.data.kaggle(..., type=\"vision\").get(...) Installation \u00b6 dataget is available at pypi so you can use your favorite package manager. pip \u00b6 pip install dataget pipenv \u00b6 pipenv install pytest poetry \u00b6 poetry add dataget Contributing \u00b6 Read our guide on Creating a Dataset if you are interested in adding a dataset to dataget.

Path The self.path field is a pathlib.Path that tells the dataset where the data should be stored. The get method ensures this path exists before calling download or load ; use this field when implementing these methods. get kwargs \u00b6 The get method will accept **kwargs which it will forward to download and load so all these methods have to accept the same arguments. An alternatively strategy is have each accept its desired required or optional arguments and accept **kwargs to accumulate the additional it doesn't need. For example: def download ( self , version , limit = None , ** kwargs ): # code def load ( self , dtype = np . float32 , ** kwargs ): # code With this implementation you the get method could be called like this: . get ( version = \"0.0.2\" , dtype = np . uint8 ) Note In the previous example the version argument is required because download uses it as a positional argument although for get its just a keyword argument, if it were not passed a TypeError would've been raised.
