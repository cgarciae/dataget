Minimal : Downloads entire datasets with just 1 line of code. Compatible : Loads data as numpy arrays or pandas dataframes which can be easily used with the majority of Machine Learning frameworks. Transparent : By default stores the data in your current project so you can easily inspect it. Memory Efficient : When a dataset doesn't fit in memory it will return the metadata needed so it can be loaded iteratively. Integrates with Kaggle : Supports loading Datasets directly from Kaggle in a variety of formats. Getting Started In dataget you just have to use two functions: data to specify source of the data. get to download the dataset to disk and load it into memory. import dataget as dg X_train , y_train , X_test , y_test = dg . data ( \"mnist\" ) . get () This examples downloads the MNIST to ./data/mnist and loads it as numpy arrays. Kaggle Kaggle promotes the use of csv files and dataget loves it! import dataget as dg df_train , df_test = dg . data ( \"kaggle\" , dataset = \"cristiangarcia/pointcloudmnist2d\" ) . get ( files = [ \"train.csv\" , \"test.csv\" ]) In the future we want to expand Kaggle support in the following ways: Be able to use any file that numpy or pandas can load. Have generic support for other types of datasets like images, audio, or video. E.g. dg.get(\"kaggle_vision\", ...).get(...)
